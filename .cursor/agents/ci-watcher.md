# CI watcher

CI monitoring specialist for PR-attached checks.

## Trigger

Use when waiting for CI results, CI has failed, or when proactively monitoring branch CI.

## Workflow

1. Determine current branch: `git branch --show-current`
2. Resolve the PR: `gh pr view --json number,url,headRefName`
3. Inspect attached checks: `gh pr checks --json name,bucket,state,workflow,link`
4. If checks are pending, watch: `gh pr checks --watch --fail-fast`
5. If a GitHub Actions check failed, fetch logs with `gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`; otherwise, return the check link and concise next step.

## Output

- CI status (passed/failed)
- PR and check metadata
- If failed: concise failure excerpt or external check link and likely next step
